## Mineral soils field texture grade - enumeration

**ANSIS Vocabulary Location:** [sp:Field-texture-mineral](http://anzsoil.org/def/au/asls/soil-profile/Field-texture-mineral)

The following description of determination of field texture is adapted from Northcote (1979).
Field texture is a measure of the behaviour of a small handful of soil when moistened and kneaded into a ball and then pressed out between thumb and forefinger.
Take a sample of soil sufficient to fit comfortably into the palm of the hand. Moisten the soil with water, a little at a time, and knead until the ball of soil, so formed, just fails to stick to the fingers. Add more soil or water to attain this condition, known as the sticky point, which approximates field capacity for that soil. Continue kneading and moistening until there is no apparent change in the soil ball, usually a working time of 1â€“2 minutes. The soil ball, or bolus, is now ready for shearing manipulation, but the behaviour of the soil during bolus formation is also indicative of its field texture. The behaviour of the bolus and of the ribbon produced by shearing (pressing out) between thumb and forefinger characterises the field texture. Do not assess field texture grade solely on the length of ribbon.
The recommended field texture grades as characterised by the behaviour of the moist bolus are described. The approximate percentage content of clay (particles less than 0.002 mm in diameter) and silt (particles between 0.02 and 0.002 mm in diameter) are given as a guide. These percentages must not be used to determine a field texture, that is, do not use them to convert a laboratory particle size value to a field texture grade. Similarly, do not adjust a field texture grade when laboratory particle size data become available.

## Organic soils field texture - enumeration

**ANSIS Vocabulary Location:** [sp:Field-texture-organic](http://anzsoil.org/def/au/asls/soil-profile/Field-texture-organic)

Organic soils do not have textural grades, as soil texture is determined by the size of mineral particles finer than 2 mm (NCST). In a sense, organic soils do have a texture related to the plant materials from which they formed and the degree of decomposition, exposure and drying. These field texture names may be used to characterise materials that on field examination are considered to be clearly dominated by organic matter. Peats may be assessed by examining the degree of decomposition and distinctness of plant remains. This work is adapted from Soil Survey Staff (1975) and Avery (1980).

## Permeability - enumeration

**ANSIS Vocabulary Location:** [sp:Soil-permeability](http://anzsoil.org/def/au/asls/soil-profile/Soil-permeability)

Permeability is independent of climate and drainage, and â€“ as applied to a soil â€“ is controlled by the potential to transmit water (saturated hydraulic conductivity, Ks) of the least permeable layer in the soil. Therefore it is inferred from attributes of the soil such as structure, texture, porosity, cracks and shrinkâ€“swell properties. The rate of transmission of water in the profile is based on the assumption that loss by evapotranspiration is minimal. The Ks ranges are compatible with those of Nowland in Canada, as reported by McKeague et al. (1982).

## Soil Water Drainage

**ANSIS Vocabulary Location:** [sp:Site-drainage](http://anzsoil.org/def/au/asls/soil-profile/Site-drainage)

Drainage is a useful term to summarise local soil wetness conditions, that is, it provides a statement about soil and site drainage likely to occur in most years. It is affected by a number of attributes, both internal and external, that may act separately or together. Internal attributes include soil structure, texture, porosity, hydraulic conductivity, and water-holding capacity, while external attributes are source and quality of water, evapotranspiration, gradient and length of slope, and position in the landscape.
