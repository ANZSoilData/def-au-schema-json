## Disturbance of site - enumeration

**ANSIS Vocabulary Location:** ls:Disturbance-of-site

These are broad categories of disturbance. Users may subdivide where considered necessary.

| JSON Value | Preferred Label | Definition Link |
| ---------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| ls:disturbance-of-site-0 | No effective disturbance; natural | |
| ls:disturbance-of-site-1 | No effective disturbance other than grazing by hoofed animals | |
| ls:disturbance-of-site-2 | Limited clearing | |
| ls:disturbance-of-site-3 | Extensive clearing | |
| ls:disturbance-of-site-4 | Complete clearing; pasture, native or improved, but never cultivated | |
| ls:disturbance-of-site-5 | Complete clearing; pasture, native or improved, cultivated at some stage | |
| ls:disturbance-of-site-6 | Cultivation; rainfed | |
| ls:disturbance-of-site-7 | Cultivation; irrigated, past or present | |
| ls:disturbance-of-site-8 | Highly disturbed | |
## Soil Water Drainage

**ANSIS Vocabulary Location:** sp:Site-drainage

Drainage is a useful term to summarise local soil wetness conditions, that is, it provides a statement about soil and site drainage likely to occur in most years. It is affected by a number of attributes, both internal and external, that may act separately or together. Internal attributes include soil structure, texture, porosity, hydraulic conductivity, and water-holding capacity, while external attributes are source and quality of water, evapotranspiration, gradient and length of slope, and position in the landscape.

| JSON Value | Preferred Label | Definition Link |
| ---------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| sp:soil-water-drainage-1 | very poorly drained | |
| sp:soil-water-drainage-2 | poorly drained | |
| sp:soil-water-drainage-3 | imperfectly drained | |
| sp:soil-water-drainage-4 | moderately well drained | |
| sp:soil-water-drainage-5 | well drained | |
| sp:soil-water-drainage-6 | rapidly drained | |
