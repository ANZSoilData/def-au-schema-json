# ANSIS JSON Base Schema
**JSON Schema Location:** [base.json](base.json)

Base properties and objects used to identify, type and link entities, bind them to schema, and otherwise describe objects from a system, rather than domain, perspective.

## Entities

### Classification

Type: *ansis-base:Classification*. ANSIS Classification. The classifier for an entity - used when an ANSIS vocabulary is not available but a formal vocabulary (the `source`) does, or should, exist.

> Expands scope of ansis:SoilClassification to support the classification of other entity types.

| Property | Value Count | ANSIS Preferred | Type | Vocabulary | Description \[ _Comment_ \] |
| -------- | ----------- | --------------- | ---- | ---------- | ------------------------- |
| id | 0..1 |  | [JSON string](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/type.html) |  | A local system identifier (i.e. not intended or guaranteed to be universally unique) for an object in the ANSIS system. \[ _Generated by ANSIS. Used to link data together during mapping and processing. After: https://jsonapi.org/format/#document-resource-object-identification_ \] |
| type | 1..1 |  | [JSON string \(iri\)](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/string.html#built-in-formats) |  | A compact URI uniquely identifying the type of the object using IDs from the OWL/RDF domain model. \[ _After: https://jsonapi.org/format/#document-resource-objects and https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/#specifying-the-type._ \] |
| value | 1..1 |  | [JSON string](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/type.html) |  | The value. |
| source | 1..1 |  | [JSON string](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/type.html) |  | A related resource from which the described resource is derived. The described resource may be derived from the related resource in whole or in part. Recommended best practice is to identify the related resource by means of a string conforming to a formal identification system. |


### Colour

Type: *ansis-base:Colour*. ANSIS Soil Colour. Undefined.

| Property | Value Count | ANSIS Preferred | Type | Vocabulary | Description \[ _Comment_ \] |
| -------- | ----------- | --------------- | ---- | ---------- | ------------------------- |
| moistureStatus | 0..1 | Y | Enumeration | [ColourMoistureStatus](./ansis-enum.md#colourmoisturestatus) | Moisture state of material while property evaluation is carried out. Soil or Mottle colour. |
| colourModel | 1..1 |  | [JSON string](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/type.html) |  | The colour model used for the value. E.g. RGB , the Munsell system, Japanese Industrial Standards colours (using Munsell notation), a value from the ASLS Mottle Colours vocabulary (Mottles only), or a colour term. |
| result | 1..1 |  | [JSON string](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/type.html) |  | A colour value structured according to the colourModel. |


### ObservableProperty

Type: *ansis-base:ObservableProperty*. Observable Property. A collection SOSA properties for an observable property value.

> Equivalent to a sosa:Observation but the observedProperty is a key in a JSON object and the feature of interest is that object.

| Property | Value Count | ANSIS Preferred | Type | Vocabulary | Description \[ _Comment_ \] |
| -------- | ----------- | --------------- | ---- | ---------- | ------------------------- |
| result | 0..1 |  |  |  | The simple value of an Observation. May be a quantity, values from and enumeration or a simple string. \[ _Observation result value rules are set for each indidual property._ \] |
| qualityOfObservation | 0..1 |  | [JSON string](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/type.html) |  | The adjudged quality of the Result. \[ _To be expanded - may be an enumeration or quantification of uncertainty._ \] |
| usedProcedure | 0..1 |  | [JSON string \(iri\)](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/string.html#built-in-formats) |  | A relation to link to a re-usable Procedure used in making an Observation, an Actuation, or a Sample, typically through a Sensor, Actuator or Sampler. Defined method (compact URI). |
| madeBySensor | 0..1 |  | [JSON string \(iri\)](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/string.html#built-in-formats) |  | Relation between an Observation and the Sensor which made the Observations. \[ _Forcing a URI on assumption of a sensor registry somewhere else._ \] |
| phenomenonTime | 0..1 |  | [JSON string \(date-time\)](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/string.html#built-in-formats); [JSON string \(date\)](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/string.html#built-in-formats) |  | The time that the Result of an Observation, applies to the FeatureOfInterest. Not necessarily the same as the resultTime. May be an interval or an instant, or some other compound temporal entity [owl-time]. \[ _Initially restricting to date-time_ \] |
| resultTime | 0..1 |  | [JSON string \(date-time\)](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/string.html#built-in-formats); [JSON string \(date\)](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/string.html#built-in-formats) |  | The result time is the instant of time when the Observation activity was completed. \[ _Initially restricting to date-time_ \] |
| sample | 0..1 |  | Pointer; [SoilSample](./ansis-entities.md#soilsample) |  | Link to the representative sample from which the observed property was measured. |


### ScopedIdentifier

Type: *ansis-base:ScopedIdentifier*. ANSIS Scoped Identifier. A simple object holding an identifier as assigned by a provider/agency. The name of the provider/agency may, optionally, be specified by the authority property.

> Based on the GML identifier (scoped name - code with with authority).

| Property | Value Count | ANSIS Preferred | Type | Vocabulary | Description \[ _Comment_ \] |
| -------- | ----------- | --------------- | ---- | ---------- | ------------------------- |
| value | 0..1 |  | [JSON string](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/type.html) |  | The value. |
| authority | 0..1 |  | [JSON string](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/type.html) |  | A name for some thing. |
