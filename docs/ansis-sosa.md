**JSON Schema Location:** [sosa.json](sosa.json)

JSON Schema definitions of the SOSA entities used by ANSIS.

## Entities

### Sampling

Type: *sosa:Sampling*. SOSA Sampling. An act of Sampling carries out a sampling Procedure to create or transform one or more samples. E.g. digging a pit through a soil sequence; dividing a field site into quadrants; sieving a powder to separate the subset finer than 100-mesh.

| Property | Value Count | ANSIS Preferred | Type | Vocabulary | Description \[ _Comment_ \] |
| -------- | ----------- | --------------- | ---- | ---------- | ------------------------- |
| id | 0..1 |  | [JSON string](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/type.html) |  | A local system identifier (i.e. not intended or guaranteed to be universally unique) for an object in the ANSIS system. \[ _Generated by ANSIS. Used to link data together during mapping and processing. After: https://jsonapi.org/format/#document-resource-object-identification_ \] |
| type | 1..1 |  | [JSON string \(iri\)](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/string.html#built-in-formats) |  | A compact URI uniquely identifying the type of the object using IDs from the OWL/RDF domain model. \[ _After: https://jsonapi.org/format/#document-resource-objects and https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/#specifying-the-type._ \] |
| result | 1..* |  | [SoilSample](./ansis-entities.md#soilsample) |  | Relation linking an act of Sampling to a Sample. |
| madeBySampler | 0..* |  | [JSON string \(iri\)](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/string.html#built-in-formats) |  | Relation linking an act of Sampling to the Sampler (sampling device or entity) that made it. \[ _Forcing a URI on assumption of a sampler registry somewhere else._ \] |
| resultTime | 0..1 |  | [JSON string \(date-time\)](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/string.html#built-in-formats); [JSON string \(date\)](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/string.html#built-in-formats) |  | The result time is the instant of time when the Observation activity was completed. \[ _Initially restricting to date-time_ \] |
| usedProcedure | 0..1 |  | [JSON string \(iri\)](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/string.html#built-in-formats) |  | A relation to link to a re-usable Procedure used in making an Observation, an Actuation, or a Sample, typically through a Sensor, Actuator or Sampler. Defined method (compact URI). |
