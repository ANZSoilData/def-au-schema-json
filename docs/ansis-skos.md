## Entities

### skos:Concept

*SKOS Concept*. Concepts are the units of thought — ideas, meanings, or (categories of) objects and events—which underlie many knowledge organization systems. As such, concepts exist in the mind as abstract entities which are independent of the terms used to label them.
