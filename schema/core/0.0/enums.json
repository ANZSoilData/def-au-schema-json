It is affected by a number of attributes, both internal and external, that may act separately or together. Internal attributes include soil structure, texture, porosity, hydraulic conductivity, and water-holding capacity, while external attributes are source and quality of water, evapotranspiration, gradient and length of slope, and position in the landscape.",
