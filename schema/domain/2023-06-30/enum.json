            "description": "The following description of determination of field texture is adapted from Northcote (1979).\r\nField texture is a measure of the behaviour of a small handful of soil when moistened and kneaded into a ball and then pressed out between thumb and forefinger.\r\nTake a sample of soil sufficient to fit comfortably into the palm of the hand. Moisten the soil with water, a little at a time, and knead until the ball of soil, so formed, just fails to stick to the fingers. Add more soil or water to attain this condition, known as the sticky point, which approximates field capacity for that soil. Continue kneading and moistening until there is no apparent change in the soil ball, usually a working time of 1–2 minutes. The soil ball, or bolus, is now ready for shearing manipulation, but the behaviour of the soil during bolus formation is also indicative of its field texture. The behaviour of the bolus and of the ribbon produced by shearing (pressing out) between thumb and forefinger characterises the field texture. Do not assess field texture grade solely on the length of ribbon.\r\nThe recommended field texture grades as characterised by the behaviour of the moist bolus are described. The approximate percentage content of clay (particles less than 0.002 mm in diameter) and silt (particles between 0.02 and 0.002 mm in diameter) are given as a guide. These percentages must not be used to determine a field texture, that is, do not use them to convert a laboratory particle size value to a field texture grade. Similarly, do not adjust a field texture grade when laboratory particle size data become available.",

In a sense, organic soils do have a texture related to the plant materials from which they formed and the degree of decomposition, exposure and drying. These field texture names may be used to characterise materials that on field examination are considered to be clearly dominated by organic matter. Peats may be assessed by examining the degree of decomposition and distinctness of plant remains. This work is adapted from Soil Survey Staff (1975) and Avery (1980).",

Its estimation will be made easier by visualising two surfaces of accordance that are planar or gently curved, one touching the major crests of a landform pattern, and the other passing through the major depressions. The average vertical separation of the two surfaces is a measure of the relief. Make this estimation at a field site, either visually or by using a map, and express it in metres.\r\nRelief is the definitive characteristic for the terms mountains, hills, low hills, rises and plains when used as types of erosional landform pattern (Table 5). The class boundaries, shown in Tables 5 and 6, are set at 300 m, 90 m, 30 m and 9 m. These class limits and the class names are similar to those used by Löffler (1974), and are broadly compatible with those of Löffler and Ruxton (1969).\r\nTable 6 lists types of landform pattern defined in the glossary according to their typical relief class. Those types for which the relief class is definitive are in italics.",
