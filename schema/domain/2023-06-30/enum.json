            "description": "The following description of determination of field texture is adapted from Northcote (1979).\r\nField texture is a measure of the behaviour of a small handful of soil when moistened and kneaded into a ball and then pressed out between thumb and forefinger.\r\nTake a sample of soil sufficient to fit comfortably into the palm of the hand. Moisten the soil with water, a little at a time, and knead until the ball of soil, so formed, just fails to stick to the fingers. Add more soil or water to attain this condition, known as the sticky point, which approximates field capacity for that soil. Continue kneading and moistening until there is no apparent change in the soil ball, usually a working time of 1–2 minutes. The soil ball, or bolus, is now ready for shearing manipulation, but the behaviour of the soil during bolus formation is also indicative of its field texture. The behaviour of the bolus and of the ribbon produced by shearing (pressing out) between thumb and forefinger characterises the field texture. Do not assess field texture grade solely on the length of ribbon.\r\nThe recommended field texture grades as characterised by the behaviour of the moist bolus are described. The approximate percentage content of clay (particles less than 0.002 mm in diameter) and silt (particles between 0.02 and 0.002 mm in diameter) are given as a guide. These percentages must not be used to determine a field texture, that is, do not use them to convert a laboratory particle size value to a field texture grade. Similarly, do not adjust a field texture grade when laboratory particle size data become available.",

Tongues of material from one horizon may penetrate into adjacent horizons. Give horizon notation as described below.\r\n\r\nAs horizon notation is deduced from the profile description data (Northcote 1979) and in some instances laboratory data, record it after the profile is described. Horizons may be difficult to name, but should be named in the field. Opinions formed at the time of description are useful for later reference.\r\n\r\nWith regard to horizon notation, the long-established usage in horizon designation is adopted. Emphasis is on factual objective notation rather than assumed genesis, as genetic implications are often uncertain and difficult to establish. Thus the notation E indicating eluvial horizon (International Society of Soil Science 1967) has not been used, even though this has been adopted by a number of overseas organisations, for example Hodgson (1974), Soil Survey Staff (1990).",

Its estimation will be made easier by visualising two surfaces of accordance that are planar or gently curved, one touching the major crests of a landform pattern, and the other passing through the major depressions. The average vertical separation of the two surfaces is a measure of the relief. Make this estimation at a field site, either visually or by using a map, and express it in metres.\r\nRelief is the definitive characteristic for the terms mountains, hills, low hills, rises and plains when used as types of erosional landform pattern (Table 5). The class boundaries, shown in Tables 5 and 6, are set at 300 m, 90 m, 30 m and 9 m. These class limits and the class names are similar to those used by Löffler (1974), and are broadly compatible with those of Löffler and Ruxton (1969).\r\nTable 6 lists types of landform pattern defined in the glossary according to their typical relief class. Those types for which the relief class is definitive are in italics.",

Certain constituents may be either depleted or enriched. Thus, in many laterite profiles, some horizons are ferruginised, partially ferruginised and partially kaolinised, and the pallid zone kaolinised. Silicification may also be associated with deep weathering profiles although not exclusively so; for instance, some limestones may be variably silicified. In contrast, calcification, which is widespread in parts of southern Australia, is not usually associated with deep weathering.",

They do not refer to observed natural clustering of slope values, since such clustering has not been shown to occur; nor do they relate precisely to boundary criteria for land use, which vary arbitrarily between organisations and which may change with advancing technology.\r\nIt may sometimes be advantageous to split each of the classes \u2018very gently inclined\u2019, \u2018gently inclined\u2019 and \u2018moderately inclined\u2019 into two levels, the appropriate boundary values being 1.8%, 5.6% and 18%.\r\nThere may also be compelling reasons for using other schemes of slope classes.

            "title": "Modal slope",
            "description": "Modal slope is defined as the most common class of slope occurring in a landform pattern. Where slope classes have been obtained by systematic sampling, define the classes using equal increments on a scale of the logarithm of the slope tangent, a procedure intended to normalise frequency distributions of observed slope (Speight 1971). Where the most common slope class is estimated by direct observation, it is thought that the estimate will compare with that calculated using the log-normal model.\r\nModal slope class determines the use of certain adjectives applied to landform patterns that are characterised by alternating crests and depressions. These are: rolling for moderate modal slopes (10\u201332%); undulating for gentle slopes (3\u201310%); and gently undulating for very gentle slopes (1\u20133%) (compare with Soil Survey Staff 1951, pages 161\u2013165). The other slope classes, precipitous, very steep, steep and level, are to be applied as they stand. The terminology for simple erosional landform patterns based on relief and modal slope is given in Table 5.\r\nTable 5 defines the category badlands by various combinations of high slope values and low relief values. These combinations imply extremely close spacing of streams or valleys. Specifically, if one assumes a sawtooth terrain profile, the valley spacing implied is less than 100 m in areas with 50 m relief and less than 30 m in areas with 5 m relief; these values appear to accord with usage.\r\nTable 7 lists types of landform pattern in order of their typical class of modal slope. This table should not be regarded as definitive, for slope within each type of landform pattern may vary widely.",

Therefore it is inferred from attributes of the soil such as structure, texture, porosity, cracks and shrink–swell properties. The rate of transmission of water in the profile is based on the assumption that loss by evapotranspiration is minimal. The Ks ranges are compatible with those of Nowland in Canada, as reported by McKeague et al. (1982).",

            "description": "Water repellence of some soils, usually sandy, is caused by a series of long-chain polymethylene waxes, made up of acids, alcohols and esters, attached to the sand grains (Ma\u2019shum et al. 1988). These soils occur Australia-wide but are more widespread in southern Australia (Wetherby 1984, McGhie and Posner 1980). Degree of repellence is assessed by determining the concentration of ethanol required to wet the sand in 10 seconds (King 1981). An abbreviated form of this method is recommended for routine field situations.",
