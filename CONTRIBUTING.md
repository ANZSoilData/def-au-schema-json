# Contributing

*These contribution guidelines are based on [Software Carpentry][swc-site] and
[Data Carpentry][dc-site] contribution instructions.*

We welcome contributions:
- fixes to existing scheme and documentation,
- bug reports,
- reviews of content and proposed changes.

## Contributor Agreement

By contributing, you agree that we may redistribute your work under [this project license](LICENSE).

## How to Contribute

The preferred way to contribute is to file an issue. This allows us to assign the item to someone
and to respond to it in a threaded discussion.

> You must have a [GitHub][github] account, or be willing to [create one][github-join].

ANSIS team members may add or change material by submitting a pull request (PR). Instructions for
doing this are [included below](#using-github).

## Using GitHub

If you choose to contribute via GitHub, you may want to look at [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub][how-contribute]. In brief:

We use [GitHub flow][github-flow] to manage changes: <br>
    1.  Create a new branch in your desktop copy of this repository for each significant change.<br>
    2.  Commit the change in that branch.<br>
    3.  Push that branch to your fork of this repository on GitHub.<br>
    4.  Submit a pull request from that branch to the [master repository][repo].<br>
    5.  If you receive feedback, make changes on your desktop and push to your branch on GitHub:
        the pull request will update automatically.
